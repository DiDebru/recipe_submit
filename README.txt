2 Assignment

In this assignment you will develop a recipe submission form. The following

technical and functional characteristics should be built.

• The module contains a page 'recipe/add’.

• The title of this page is ‘Submit a recipe’.

• This page is only accessible when a user has the permission

‘recipe_add’.

• On this page a form is being presented to the user. The form contains

the following mandatory fields.

o A text field with the recipe title

o A text field with the author name

o A text field with the email address of the author. This field should

validate the entered email address. An error message is shown

to the user when the email address isn’t valid.

o A text area for a recipe description. This field will have a

maximum of 500 characters. If the user entered more then 500

characters an error message will be shown.

o A text area for recipe instructions.

o A text area for recipe ingredients.

• The form will have a submit button with the text ‘Submit recipe’

• After the form is being submitted and validated, the data is stored in a

database table. During installation of this module the table is

automatically created.

• Use column names that correspond with the field names.

o The table also stores a recipe ‘id’ as primary key, which is

automatically incremented.

o A Unix timestamp for the submitted date and time.

o The current site language in ISO code.

• After the submission and data store, the user will be redirected to the

homepage. A ‘success’ status message is shown to the user.

• Individual detail pages of recipes can be viewed on urls structured like:

recipe/1 or recipe/2.

• Recipe detail pages are only accessible when a user has the permission

‘recipe_manage’.

• Recipe HTML output is being generated by a theme function and a

template file.

• All the presented fields should be in one unordered list. Timestamp

should be shown as a ‘long’ Drupal date format.

• After a successful submission an email notification is being send to the

predefined email address, which is stored in system wide variable. Try

to accomplish this with a famous and highly popular contributed module.

Also make sure that the receiving email address is differentiated based

on the submission language of the recipe.

• The setting of the default email address is set on a separate

administration page (for example ‘admin/recipe’ only accessible with

recipe_manage permissions). When this field isn’t set, no notification

email is being send.

• Subject of the email is ‘New recipe’.

• The body of the email contains a URL to the detail view of the recipe.
